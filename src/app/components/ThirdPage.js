                        According to the Galician art critic, David Barro: &quot;In
                        the works of Luis Kerch, the landscape blurs away
                        and the image is destroyed to trigger the imagination.
                        All things pictorial are led to their absolute boundary.
                        That is why there is always something beyond what
                        we can see, and experience is overtaken by vertigo.
                        A reality that we neither see nor can describe, but the
                        existence of which we are able to deduce.&quot;

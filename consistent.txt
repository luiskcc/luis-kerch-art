Do whatever you have to do to make the site consistent:

-Texts margins and paddings consistent and with enough spacing
- Make sure the flow stays the same but with enough margin in between images and Texts
- The width of the texts as to be consistent
- Respect the dynamic of each individual image as they have different formats for both small and large screens

-We are using this stack

Next.js
vanilla JS
Tailwind.css 
(No React)

-Based on the images in the @public folder that have already been ordered. I want you to please create a component for each image:

-Following its order starting off just after the @FirstPage.js  and finish off just before @WeavingLight.js 


*Considerations:

There is existing files and components already, please follow more or less the existing style 
It has to be homogeneous simple layout and follow responsiveness

It's pretty straight

Thank you good-sir
